Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¥
A fully responsive and visually appealing web application designed to replicate the core features of Netflix. This project showcases my ability to build dynamic user interfaces, work with external APIs, and handle complex styling for web applications. The Netflix Clone serves as a practical example of modern web development techniques, focusing on React.js and integration with third-party services.

Overview:
The Netflix Clone project mimics the functionality and design of the Netflix platform. Users can browse a variety of movies and TV shows, categorized by genre, and access trailers for selected titles. The app dynamically fetches movie data using the TMDb API, providing up-to-date content.

Features:

Dynamic Home Page:

Showcases a featured movie or TV show banner.
Includes multiple rows of movies categorized by genre.

Genre Browsing:

Movies and TV shows are organized into rows by genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Horror).
Infinite scrolling for exploring extensive content.

Search Functionality:

Allows users to search for specific titles.
Real-time results fetched via API.

Movie Trailers:

View official trailers for movies directly within the app.

Responsive Design:

Optimized for seamless viewing across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Performance Optimization:

Lazy loading for images to improve speed.
Efficient API request handling to reduce unnecessary calls.
